These stickers are the cutest ever! They’re a fun way to get the animal rights message out there in a simple yet effective way. I’ve been spamming all of my friends with them and even got a few of them to download this app as well! If you love animals, you NEED this app. Hurry up, and download it already!

I’m glad to have making a difference in a company dedicated to having my voice be heard in such vigorous and hasty situations world wide that helps better understand and sticks to the moral values of what it means to protect, to care and deeply love our fellow creatures to ban the labs, the testing the shelter killings that exposes the vulnerability our animals are facing so immensely that. We have to recognize and identify with the places only care about the money than we do so that’s why I’m honored to be part of a community based off the support of the values I look for in animals hoping to prevent future exposure of our animals and creatures out there that are dying and getting killed and being sick cos we try to have the amount of usage to help them being existed not extinct. So that’s why I want to help reverse that with a company project I’m working that can help with understanding the communicational skills we have to be more up close with our creatures and souls of our world. Which is the philosophy to be empowered by the echos and vibes of them to be co existing with them not killing them and creating more programs that can learn more sophisticated of it and my company is called Supernatural Energies Incorporation. That is to inspire a new level of animal and spirit like prodigies to serve and protect the world than killing it.

I LOVE this app
I’ve always been a really big advocate for animal rights, ever since I was a little kid, because I’ve had pets my entire life. When I started to learn about all the barbaric things people were doing to animals, I knew I needed to take action. I’ve since then cut out brands that test on animals from my life, and I’ve been encouraging my family members to do the same (and to some degrees it’s working!) and when I heard about the PETA app, I IMMEDIATELY downloaded it. It’s completely free (which I love) and the app itself is incredibly easy to navigate. I love that I can learn about current events that are happening with animal rights, and i love how I can just click a button and an email will be sent to the companies that are being cruel to animals, to (hopefully) get them to stop doing whatever it is they’re doing. The ONLY thing I wish the app would have is the option to create your own avatar, and then once you get more star points, you can unlock more outfits and stuff. Other than that, I think this is a great app.

I totally love the app
I, overall, enjoy being part of PETA. What I really like about the app, though, is that you get ranked up by helping in different causes, like sending emails to organizations doing

In this case I was the sole contact working directly with the freelance developer, coordinating and gathering data for updates, approving language, writing copy, managing images and the iOS App Store. 

Check if a company is cruelty-free! Bunny Free lets you search for companies by name and tells you whether or not they test on animals.


Bunny Free uses data from the cruelty-free shopping guide published by People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA). The information is updated on a regular basis.

It had its heyday... is a bit dated today. Maybe should leave the ratings off for this one? 

Had a bit more creative control over the design on this one, but my only critique would be that the project was started a bit late in the consumer adoption curve. When I came into the project, I was able to redesign things, but it was a race to constantly keep the app up to date with different products. 

33.7% Increase In-Return Users month over month
12% Increase in page views and a 5% increase in time on page month over month after my redesigns

Great idea, very useful, room for improvements
Great idea of an app, very useful so far, room for improvements of course like better search capabilities. I have found all the companies I have searched for so far but only used it for a short time since I download it. It's a free app so that's another plus. It helps animals so that's a great app already. I will continue to use it more, and review it again in a few months.

Bigger database?
As another reviewer mentioned, I'm not sure why all the reviews are quite so high, given the database limitations: with such a tremendous cosmetics industry, there is relatively little covered here.


I wasn't expecting 100% coverage; there's too much out there for that. However, if you try to browse (for example) Sephora with this app in hand, you're going to strike out a lot-- and that's a fairly limited range of products.


When it works, it works, though. It gives a concise yes/no answer and relevant company contact info. PETA's website is extremely comprehensive, but, of course, that's difficult to browse on the run, which is why this app is a good idea.


I'm hoping for further updates; it's very simple to use and has a very clean look. The only thing lacking is more a more complete information bank.

Good, but it needs more
This app is pretty good. However, Im not too impressed with the limited selection. It has a lot of good stuff, but it doesn't have most of the things I was searching for. It is
