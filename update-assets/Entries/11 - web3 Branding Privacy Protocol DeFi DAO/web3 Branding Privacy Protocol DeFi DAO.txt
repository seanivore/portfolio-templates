Worked branding as Art Director at a DeFi Privacy Protocol DAO in Web3. Created thousands of pieces of brand art, including drawing all new hires as Anime characters from the CEOs favorite show. I also produced product marketing asset in the form of a comic book explaining complex topics to the everyday person. We printed over 3,000 copies of the book. Additionally, they were so very obsessed with Pepe the frog and I made over 200 different versions.

Turning dapp dev team into anime characters
Working as Creative Director, a 1-man creative team at a DeFi startup of all developers and doctorates of Cryptography, getting to know my remote coworkers living across the globe started with my favorite ice breaker yet: Getting self photos from a individuals who covet their digital anonymity simply out of moral principal and obligation. So I morphed their photos into popular anime characters, working closely with them as to how alike or unlike their own photo they felt comfortable with for an image published online. 

For real though, advocates for privacy are not shady in the least, definitely not doing anything criminal, but rather fighting for human rights most of us take for granted. 

Since started those two years prior, Silent DAO achieved a technological first by developing a identity validation product that confirms who you are without revealing to anyone who you are. By using MATH. Wild right? 

I'm no computer scientist or cryptographer, but what they created used a novel version of a "zero knowledge proof" to be specific. No other web3 developer has been able to achieve the same and get approval from financial regulators like Silent has. Game. Changer. 

Why all the effort? Because a decentralized internet will transforming society, bringing us closer to equality without giving up our capitalistic free market values. The potential to end human suffering and bring millions of people around the globe out of poverty, hunger, famine, war. The centralized internet is the wild west where private companies create billionaires, while pushing others into an uncountable number of dangerous situations. Technology has come far enough to run companies, processes, and even automate entire jobs. The time had come to being cutting the top of antiquated corporate and governance structures off. The money saved going back to the people, to users of a service, holders of traditional-stock-like tokens value and back into the organization. Any need for human input could be handled by those token holders making decisions using simple majority rules voting right on the blockchain. 

Still, this technological shift to a carefully organized and extremely secure web3 internet clearly seemed like an idealistic college freshman's delusions of grandeur. It was too unlike any prior system of authority as leadership for production of goods and services. The FULLY transparent nature of blockchain technology that is web3 would always be too much of an ask. Why bank somewhere that has to leave transactional data public if you can drive across town where no one knows you or can find where you went? 

The stakes were high for all: privacy is an essential cornerstone of democracy. It allows us to push back on any autocratic attempts at power grabs. It helps us keep those with power from abusing it. Finally, Silent started to roll out exactly what can help web3 fully form — a way for users to enjoy the same privacy they enjoy offline. Still today as I post this in December 2022 no other protocol has achieved this mathematical, cryptographic miracle and gained the approval of financial regulators, except for Silent. 

The future is going to hit us hard, very soon, but in the best way any human has yet been able to figure. 

Below are avatars of some of the people who made it happen. Curious if the history books will also keep their names anonymous. 

But FWIW, this artist, strategist, neurodivergent problem solver and capitalist is at bottom right 😉 🙋

Intricately drawn digital art scene depicting the luxury that this web3 startup's expertly-coded, regulations-approved, zero knowledge proof-based protocol will inadvertently push global living standards towards. Finally, privacy for anyone using a smart contract, in fact any smart contract. A protocol layer that turned catalyst ushering in a coming technological shift so efficient, it reallocates global resources — namely, our data of basically everything, excess capital squandered on labor that could be automated were the world not stuck in a dated corporate management structure — simply by design. But it was a design that would never have been fully adopted without that lovely little privacy option. Life offline can now be as private as life online and the people are here for it! 
Be prepared. Likely to shift this century, you'll probably end up having a lot of free time. Fewer employees in every industry over time, replaced by the free labor that is automation + robotics + general AI can only end with things become far cheaper. 

Imagine being home on a weekday, bored. You pull out your phone, open a dapp, and turn on the setting to "share" your behavioral data with the dapps partner advertising DAO. In return, rather than companies stealing data to strategize ads they arbitrarily pay to have made and then to place, they will slurp up your data into their database, feed it to their data scientists and potentially a quantum computer — meaning there is no reason our efficiency-focused system can't almost instantly pay you top dollar for those bits of data that better informed the systems ad targeting and thus effectiveness. Perhaps it'll be  pennies for your online behavior, perhaps dollars, but that change will be coming in constantly for any data you consent to sell, in a world where everything now costs pennies and dollars. 

Meanwhile, we'll put our kids in arts schools, or learn to paint, maybe take violin lessons. Whatever talent you can find that gives you something to provide to the data monster for your pennies. 

Image a generation of angrily bored elders who grew up in our old meritocracy and think the new world of making income by participating in online society feels vaguely like communism will slowly pass from the collective. With each confused soul lost, the young will gain space and confidence to love their new normal. Work is subjective, right? 

But if *not* communism, perhaps a free market shared resource economy is a fitting term. The freedom to choose a living still exists, even while now everything can be easily afforded by everyone: the nicest dwellings and clothes made to last and to impress. 

It is then we will start to wonder, what is luxury? Was luxury? The word requires comparison of social class material ownership. But when the good life is all but given freely to anyone willing to play a game online or post their whereabouts or share their interests, will we find a new word? More likely a new definition. Success has changed; shifting to being part of the collective in some way. 

All those new decentralized companies, running leaderless thanks to infallible tech that uses un-hackable encryption and ledger distribution tactics mixed with some freaky AI that troubleshoots itself; this ushers in a great equalization that all but eliminates classist income gap. All by employing mathematical innovation into our a free market economy. Life is good.
